        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal of joining AltSchool Africa is for career development. I
          have always had a passion for Tech. The intruige has pushed me to
          learning more about the industry and how I can be part of something
          meaningful and bigger than myself. The prospect of gaining hands-on
          experience, being part of a community that fosters collaboration and
          coming up with innovative solutions to problems greatly appeals to me.
          Also, the project based culture, possibilities of mentorship and
          internships also spurred me on to enroll and develop myself.
