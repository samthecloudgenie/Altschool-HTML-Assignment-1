        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal of joining AltSchool Africa is for career development. I
          have always had a passion for Tech. The intruige has pushed me to

          experience, being part of a community that fosters collaboration and
          coming up with innovative solutions to problems greatly appeals to me.
